pic12F683 Pair of dice Charlieplexed LEDs
=========================================

This project is one possible implementation for the question in thread:

Four pins are used for the LEDs, one pin is used for switch input.

The application is written using the Microchip XC8 compiler in (free) mode so there is a lot of code bloat.
